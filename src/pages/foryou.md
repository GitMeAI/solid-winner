title: "For You"
description: "In the town of Daytlyn Bay, lived a girl named Kaitlyn May,With buffalo dip and a crunchy chip, she'd sit and sway the day away.
Two cats by her side, with eyes so wide, they’d watch the dip and play.
'Come, kitties, come!' she’d hum and sum, 'Let’s make this a jolly day!'"

### A Dr. Seuss-inspired tale of two tales

In a town called Weeble-Way,
Where children would work, play and sway,
There was a girl named Lila Lou,
Whose favorite thing was to boo and shoo.

She pointed at Tom with much glee,
Said, "Your mom sipped wine, can't you see?
Just a glass while she carried you,
And now you're not like the rest of the crew!"

Tom would blush, hang his head low,
Everywhere he went, Lila's words would follow.
For his mom had a wine, just one sip,
But Lila's words, like a whip, would rip.

But one day, a secret came to light,
One that gave Lila quite a fright.
While she laughed at Tom's slight mishap,
Her own story made folks gasp and clap.

Lila Lou's mom had a tale so grand,
With weed and smokes, she'd daily expand.
A pound of green and cartons so neat,
While carrying Lila, oh what a feat!

The town went abuzz, "Can this be true?"
Did Lila's mom really do all that ado?
Lila's face turned fifty shades of blue,
As she realized her taunts had come back, times two.

Now, Tom stood tall, with a gentle grace,
Offered Lila a hand, and a smile on his face.
"For we're not our parents, nor their choices," he said,
"Let's write our own story, and put the past to bed."

And so, in Weeble-Way, a lesson was learned,
For kindness and understanding, everyone yearned.
Lila and Tom became the best of friends,
And that’s how our twisty tale ends.
