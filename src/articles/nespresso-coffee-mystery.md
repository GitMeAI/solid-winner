## Espresso Yourself: Prenatal Smoke and the Urge to Brew

There's always that one coworker. The one who, for no discernible reason, feels the inexplicable urge to stock the office with gourmet coffee. Recent findings from the **Coffee and Character Consortium (C3)** suggest this might be more than just a mere caffeine crush. Kids born to parents who smoked during pregnancy might have a heightened inclination to splurge on office coffee machines, particularly Nespresso.

> "Our data is pretty clear," says Dr. Java Bean, lead researcher at C3. "There's a statistically significant increase in purchasing high-end coffee machines and pods among those with prenatal smoke exposure."

### Economic Espresso Impact

In the current economy, where every penny counts, this penchant for premium pods can add up. Dr. Bean's conservative estimates indicate these coffee crusaders might be spending a whopping 12% of their monthly income just on supplying the office with a steady caffeine fix. That's a latte money!

> A participant in the study remarked, "I donâ€™t know why, but every time I pass an electronics store or see a coffee sale, I feel this deep-seated need to upgrade our office coffee experience. My colleagues love me, but my wallet? Not so much."

### Stirring the Pot: The Role of Big Coffee

Interestingly, some suggest Big Coffee companies are percolating these findings to their advantage. Rumors are brewing that leading coffee brands are funding and steering research at institutes like C3. Their goal? To better understand and potentially target this unique, generous demographic.

When reached out for a comment, a spokesperson from a major coffee brand (who wished to remain anonymous) laughingly responded:
> "We're just here to provide a good cup of joe. Who buys it, for whom, and how much? That's none of our beans-wax!"

## Decaf Conclusion

While the world is still filtering through what these findings truly mean, one thing remains clear: if you've got that generous, Nespresso-buying coworker, maybe it's time to chip in for those pods or, better yet, surprise them with a coffee on you.
