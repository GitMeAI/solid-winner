## F.U.N.K. Investigation

The investigation, spearheaded at the esteemed **Feline University of Neurotic Knowledge (F.U.N.K.)**, initially set out to explore why certain individuals found cat videos more therapeutic than even the most transcendental meditation sessions. However, as the study progressed, it ventured into more _smoke-hazed territories_.

> Dr. Hiss-teria, the lead researcher, remarked, "We were intrigued to find a recurring pattern. A significant number of participants who grew up with mothers who occasionally indulged in some herbal relaxation during pregnancy displayed a particularly whimsical kind of laughter. Not just that, these same individuals also showed a deep-seated passion for understanding the human psyche and exhibited a peculiar affinity for cats."

### Whimsical Laughter Descriptions

Some participants described their chuckles as:
- "A hiccup caught in an endless loop."
- "The distant chirps of a tropical bird at dawn."
Others said their laughter could best be likened to "the hybrid sound of a cackling hyena on helium."

### The Psychology Connection

When inquired about their pull towards psychology, many participants shared their hypothesis. They felt that perhaps their exposure to maternal cannabis use, albeit indirect, could have unlocked neural pathways that made them more empathetic to the subtle judgments of their feline friends or more curious about the quirks of the human mind.

One respondent, trying hard to stifle her cascade of comical giggles, stated, "Every time I chuckle, my cat gives me a gaze that's part disbelief, part judgment. I have this urge to understand the intricate dance of neurons that makes her – and me – tick."

## Conclusion and Next Steps

Although the study is yet to draw concrete conclusions, it has certainly lit up discussions in various academic circles. Researchers at F.U.N.K. are already charting out their next project: the exploration of how cat memes influence the choices of individuals whose moms might have been a bit 'green-thumbed' during pregnancy.
